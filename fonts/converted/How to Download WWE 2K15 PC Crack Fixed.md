A crack file is a modified version of a game's executable file that bypasses the copy protection and allows the game to run without requiring a valid license key or disc. Cracks are usually created by hackers or groups of hackers who distribute them online for free. However, cracks are also illegal and may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer. Therefore, you should always be careful when downloading cracks from unknown sources and scan them with an antivirus program before using them.
